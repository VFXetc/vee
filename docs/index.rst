VEE: Versioned Execution Environment
====================================


This project aims to encapsulate various package Packages in order to allow for
consistent, versioned assembly of an execution environment across a fleet of
OS X and Linux hosts.

Eventually, VEE may provide continuous deployment.

The initial goal is to include packages from:

- Homebrew_ (and linuxbrew_);
- the `Python Package Index <PyPI_>`_;
- ad-hoc Python packages;
- ad-hoc general packages.
